  bestTimeToVisit: 'Bwindi is open year-round, but the best time for gorilla trekking is during dry months of June-August and December-February when forest trails are less muddy and slippery. Rain season (March-April, September-November) is perfect for bird watching during breeding season but challenging for trekking.',
  gettingThere: 'By Road: 8-9 hour drive from Kampala/Entebbe through scenic countryside. 4-hour drive from Kigali, Rwanda (shortest route). By Air: Charter flights from Entebbe to Kihihi or Kisoro airstrips, then short drive to park.',
  conservation: 'Bwindi plays a crucial role in mountain gorilla conservation, protecting nearly half of the world\'s remaining population. Tourism revenue directly funds anti-poaching efforts, ranger salaries, and community development. The park also supports displaced Batwa communities through employment and cultural tourism programs.',
  specialFeatures: {
    fallsDetails: 'The name "Bwindi" comes from the native word "Mubwindi" meaning "a place of darkness" - a dark, difficult place to penetrate. This ancient forest is believed to be one of the few that flourished through the last ice age, withstanding millennia of climate changes to remain one of Earth\'s richest botanical reserves.',
    filmHistory: 'Bwindi\'s mountain gorillas share 98% of human DNA, making them our closest living relatives. The emotional connection visitors feel when looking into a gorilla\'s eyes is often described as life-changing - a recognition of kinship that transcends species.',
    historicalNotes: 'Originally conserved as Crown Forest Reserve in 1942 (Kayonza and Kasatora), combined and renamed Impenetrable Central Crown Forest. Became animal sanctuary in 1964 to protect mountain gorillas, then upgraded to national park status in 1991 alongside Mgahinga and Rwenzori reserves.',
    fishingInfo: 'The park serves as a vital water catchment with rivers Ishasha, Ihihizo, Ivi, Ntengyere, and Munyaga flowing into larger lakes like Mutanda, Edward, and Bunyonyi. Lake Mutanda offers excellent canoeing opportunities with views of Virunga Mountains.',
    campingDetails: 'The park receives heavy rainfall year-round with cool temperatures even when other parts of Uganda are hot and dry. This creates the perfect misty, mysterious atmosphere that makes Bwindi truly feel like stepping into an ancient world untouched by time.'
